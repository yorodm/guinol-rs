# Guinol-rs

An attempt to create a runtime agnostic, async client for the
Firefox's Marionette Protocol.

## Current status.

This is not working and it won't work for a few more weeks. I'm still
figuring out how to tackle some issues.

## Contributors

I got the idea while browsing [njasm golang
implementation](https://github.com/njasm/marionette_client) so credit
it's due and given.
